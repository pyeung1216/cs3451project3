Computer Graphics Project 3: Ray Tracing

http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/cs3451_2014_spring/hw3/hw3.html

Objective

The goal of this project is to write a ray tracing renderer. Your program should be able to read scene data from a file according to a defined scene description language. From this, your program will then render an image of the scene and write out the image to a file. In this project we will use just two geometric primitives: spheres and triangles. We will implement shadows and reflection, but not refraction.
